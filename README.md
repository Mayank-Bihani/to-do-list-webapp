# to-do-list-webapp
# a clean UI to-do list app, which gives you following functionalities:
1) you can add the items to your list.
2) you can edit your added items (for the error prone human in all of us ;p )
3) you can delete the item.
4) it also fetches data from an api once, when the site loads.
5) It can store all your data in local storage, so that you wont lose out on the pending tasks even if you close your browser or refresh it.
6) You do not want the api fetched data? no worries, once you edit/delete them they won't reappear as the data is fetched just once and it is also stored in the local data.
7) Really easy to use, so I am not putting 'how to use' instructions here, just some bragging about the app xD.
